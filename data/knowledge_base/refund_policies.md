# Refund and Cancellation Policies

## Refundable Tickets

Refundable tickets can be canceled up to 48 hours before departure, subject to a 10% processing fee.

If you cancel more than 48 hours before departure, the refund will be processed within 7–10 business days to the original form of payment, minus the 10% processing fee.

## Non-Refundable Tickets

Non-refundable tickets generally cannot be refunded. In some cases, you may receive a credit or voucher for future travel, minus applicable change and cancellation fees. Terms vary by airline.

## Cancellation Windows

- **More than 48 hours before departure**: Full refund minus processing fee (refundable tickets only).
- **24–48 hours before departure**: Refundable tickets may still be eligible subject to the 10% fee; check your fare rules.
- **Less than 24 hours before departure**: Refunds are typically not available; consider travel insurance for last-minute changes.

## Change Fees

Changing the date or route of a ticket may incur a change fee in addition to any fare difference. Refundable fares often have lower or no change fees. Check your booking confirmation for the exact terms.
