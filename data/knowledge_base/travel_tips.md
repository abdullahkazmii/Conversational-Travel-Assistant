# General Travel Tips

## Before You Go

- Check visa requirements and passport validity (often 6 months beyond your return date).
- Take copies of your passport, visa, and travel insurance; store them separately from the originals.
- Notify your bank of travel dates to avoid card blocks.

## Best Time to Visit

- **Tokyo / Japan**: Spring (March–May) for cherry blossoms; autumn (September–November) for mild weather and fall colors.
- **Paris / France**: April–June and September–October for fewer crowds and pleasant weather.
- **London / UK**: May–September for warmer weather; book in advance for popular events.

## What to Pack

- Adaptors for the destination country’s plugs.
- Comfortable shoes for walking and any dress code required for visits (e.g. religious sites).
- A small first-aid kit and any regular medications in original packaging.

## Money and Connectivity

- Inform your bank of travel; consider a small amount of local currency or a travel card.
- Check roaming or local SIM options for phone and data.
