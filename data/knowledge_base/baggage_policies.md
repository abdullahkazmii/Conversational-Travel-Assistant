# Baggage Policies

## Cabin Baggage (Carry-On)

Most airlines allow one piece of cabin baggage (e.g. 55 cm x 35 cm x 25 cm or 22 in x 14 in x 9 in) plus one small personal item (handbag, laptop bag). Weight limits for cabin bags are often 7–10 kg (15–22 lb). Check your airline’s website for exact dimensions and weight.

## Checked Baggage

Checked baggage allowance depends on fare type and route. Economy fares often include one checked bag (e.g. 23 kg / 50 lb). Premium and business fares may include two or more bags. Excess baggage is subject to fees.

## Restricted and Prohibited Items

Liquids in carry-on must be in containers of 100 ml or less and placed in a single transparent bag. Sharp objects, certain batteries, and flammable items are restricted or prohibited in both cabin and checked luggage. Always check the airline and airport rules before packing.
